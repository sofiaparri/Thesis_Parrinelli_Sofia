    spherical microphone array.
Main file to run: mainSimulation.m

1. run ita_pth.m
2. Don't modify configParams.m but create tune.cfg for only different values parameters.
3. run mainSimulation('tune.cfg');

Added to version 1:
Added option to drift the source in the spacial domain using only
    samples of the translated source.
Properties of "if the source was in the center" are saved in params/state.center.
Properties of translated source are saved in params/state.translation.
Uniting load-save stages.

Added to version 2:
Added option to drift the source in the spacial domain using only
    samples of the translated source.
Properties of "if the source was in the center" are saved in params/state.center.
Properties of translated source are saved in params/state.translation.
Uniting load-save stages.

Added to version 3:
Calculate the errors of high order spherical harmonics coefficients
    for each assumed center location.

Added in 29.11.2013:
Add an error function that calculates the preservation of the directivity
    for directional sources.
Add frequency dependent center to the simulated source.

Added in 1.1.2014:
Recorded data from microphone arrays can be used.
Found out that directivity-preservation criterion is not only for directional sources if extremum is considered and not only minumum.
The directivity-preservation error is no longer rotating the maximal radiation towars the z axes,
Realizing that this error function suits better in x-y plane and works better if z is assumed far from the center.
Creating additional error function for the y-z plane that works better when x is assumed far from the center.

Added in 3.2.2014:
Added option to compensate the measurements with microphone directivities.
Discarding rotation according to maximum and minimum.
Now there are only J0-3 from original paper of Ben Hagai et al,
J4 for x-y plane, J5 for y-z plane, and J6 for x-z plane.

Added in 19.6.2014
Work with frequency cubes generated by applications/DirectivityMeasurementCalibration.
Baloon plot with phase color.
