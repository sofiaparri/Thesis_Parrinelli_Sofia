%% Getting startet with the ITA-Toolbox

% <<../../pics/ita_toolbox_logo_wbg.png>>
% 
% In the next few lines we (the Developers of the ITA-Toolbox from the 
% Institute of Technical Acoustics at RWTH Aachen) will try to explain 
% how to work with the basic objects (instances of a class) for audio 
% data called itaAudio, arbitrary time or frequency data objects 
% (where the transform between time and frequency is not possible) 
% called itaResult and single values, consisting of a value and a 
% physical unit called itaValue. Some basic signal processing tasks
% are also dealt with. It is recommended to open the tutorial as a Live
% Script.

%% Introduction to class |itaValue|
% Let's assume we want to multiply a mass of 5.2 kg with an accelaration of
% 9.81m/s^2 to obtain the gravitational force. Then we like to obtain the
% pressure on a surface of 2 m^2. Have a look at the class documentation to
% see overloaded operators and functions and properties.

m = itaValue(5.2,'kg');
g = itaValue(9.81,'m/s^2');

F = m*g

S = itaValue(2,'m^2');
p = F/S


%% Introduction to class |itaCoordinates|
% There are a few functions that get you started with the coordinate class.
% After initialization, you have instant access to the coordinates in
% (3D)-cartesian, spherical and cylindrical coordinates. All coordinate
% transforms are handled in the background, so you do not need to care
% about them anymore. As angles the radians is used in common mathematical
% coordinate systems.

% initialize a list of N data points
N = 20;
coord = itaCoordinates(N);

% the number of points can be obtained with
coord.nPoints

% now lets set the x- and y-axis to random values
coord.x = rand(N,1);
coord.y = rand(N,1);
% we set z to a constant value
coord.z = 1;

% now we can examine the data, as cartesian N x 3 matrix
coord.cart      % all data

% or as spherical coordinates, or as single components
coord.sph       % all data
coord.theta
coord.phi
coord.r

% the cylindrical coordinates are somehow related to both other ones,
% allowing to access
coord.cyl       % all data
coord.rho       % together with coord.phi and coord.z

%%% Spherical distribution of points
% Let's make a common set of spherically distributed points, we pick a 
% 5°/5° (theta/phi) resolution and visualize the result.
coord = ita_generateSampling_equiangular(5,5);
% we can visualize the points in the 3D space
scatter(coord);
% here as later: use your mouse to rotate, pan or zoom the plots

% Line plot of some parts of the points
% Plot the first 1000 points in the given order. This is useful for
% turn-table measurements, for example:
plot(coord.n(1:1000));

% Balloon plot to visualize geometries
% We can also plot a balloon stlye plot.
surf(coord, coord.r);


% or plot dipole
surf(coord, cos(coord.theta));

%% Introduction to class |itaAudio|
% This class is used for all kinds of audio signal processing, reaching
% from importing signals like music, towards measurements of e.g. speech or
% even impulse responses of LTI systems.
%
% Let's assume we want to manually generate a sine of frequency 2000 Hz,
% with a length of 2 seconds and a sampling rate of 44100 Hz with an
% amplitude of 1 Pa. (The same could be done for frequency data as well.)

%Create an empty audio object
sine = itaAudio;
% Set sampling rate
sine.samplingRate = 44100;
% Set comment for entire audio object
sine.comment = 'My first Sine object with 2000 Hz';
% Comment for the first channel
sine.channelNames{1} = 'this is the first channel with the sine';
% Change the length of the audio track
sine.trackLength = 2;

% Now we have a timeVector containing the sampled time from 0 to 2 seconds
t = sine.timeVector;

% Let's set the time data, you could use your own MATLAB data here !
sine.time = sin(2*pi*2000 * t);
sine = sine * itaValue(1,'Pa'); %include a suitable physical unit
sine.channelNames{1} = 'First sine'

% Let's get the frequency data of this object as double vector
spk = sine.freq;

% Let's get the physical unit of the first channel as a string
unitStr = sine.channelUnits{1}

% We will do a second sine with 5 Pa and the same frequency
% Amplify by simple multiplication
sine2 = sine * 5;
% Assign a new channel name
sine2.channelNames{1} = 'The copy of the first sine with an amplitude of 5 Pa';

% Put them together in one object
sine_comp = merge(sine, sine2);

% Find out if the data of the audio object is saved in the time or 
% frequency domain
sine.domain

% Convert to frequency domain with ' (fft)
sine = sine';
sine.domain

% Convert back to time domain with .' (ifft)
sine = sine.';

% Have a look at the workspace and the various types of the variables we 
% created - Congratulations so far! :-)

%% Plotting and ITA-Toolbox GUI 
% We have finished our nice sine signal and can start to plot it right away. 
% There are different plots or different domains you might want to look at. 
% We go trough all plots and you should pay attention to the signal content
% you see there. The different plots allow the user to concentrate on 
% different aspects of the signal.

sine.plot_freq

% You can use the *ITA-Toolbox GUI* which gives you additional tools and 
% features, e.g. to switch domain. The GUI always works in the main 
% workspace; this enables you to switch between GUI and command line. 
% In the GUI you can you can change the current audio variable you want to 
% look at by clicking the menu point "Workspace".

% Click at the menu point "Domain" and see what's possible there.

% Try to get the second sine (sine2) in the frequency domain by using the 
% menu points in the GUI. Compare it with the following and make sure you 
% understand why they are the same.
sine_comp.ch(2).plot_freq

% Multiply in frequency domain with *
res = sine * sine2;
res.channelNames{1} = 'Convolution of two sines';
res.plot_freq
% Multiply in time domain with .*
res = sine .* sine2;
res.channelNames{1} = 'Multiplication of two sines in time domain';
res.plot_freq
% Compare the convolution and the multiplication of the two sines. Do you
% notice the differences? Also have a look on both plots in the time domain
% by using the menu points of the GUI.

%% TASK 1 -- Noise signal
% Generate a signal with the sampling rate of 44100 Hz and the length of 2
% seconds with a random noise by using MATLAB's randn(). Have a look at the
% time signal and the spectrum.
s = itaAudio;

% HERE COMES YOUR CODE
% s.samplingRate = 
% s.comment = 
% s.channelNames{1} =
% s.trackLength =
% s.time =

%% Audio Signal Processing with Music Signal
% Open a music file. This could also be a measurement or recording.
s = ita_demosound;

% Get a nice mono signal
s = mean(s); %overloaded operator for itaAudio

% Have a look at the time domain/frequency domain and the spectrogram with
% the GUI
s.plot_time;

% Play back the signal
s.play;

%%% Filtering
% Let's apply a low and high pass, that means we actually apply a bandpass, 
% to the original music signal. In this case we take the band limitations 
% from a telephone line.

f_low  = 300;  % 300 Hz lower cut off
f_high = 4000; % 4000 Hz upper cut off
g = ita_filter_bandpass(s,'lower',f_low,'upper',f_high);

% Have a look at the results
g.plot_freq 

% Play back the telephone emulation
g.play

%% TASK -- Manipulation of Impulse Responses
% Impulse responses of LTI system (linear time-invariant system) have in 
% general some characterics that can be very useful to post-process 
% measurements. We know for example that the information of the LTI system 
% has to be causal (everything in the real world answers after the question 
% has been asked) and the systems have a characteristic decay time. For 
% example, the decay time (reverberation time) is for small conference 
% rooms about 0.5-0.7 seconds, in lecturing halls about 0.7-1 seconds and 
% in a church around 5-15 seconds. Loudspeakers on the other hand decay 
% very quickly with a constant less than 20 ms. A time window in the 
% impulse response can be used to separate the desired signal from 
% background noise and other artefacts of the measurement. These artefacts 
% could be the response of a room in the measurement, although we wanted to
% measure the loudspeaker under free field conditions. But who has a 
% free-field available at home?
%
% Use the cursors to zoom into the first part on the impulse response. Set
% the cursors to a range and choose "Edit" -> "Window" to apply a fade out
% between the two cursors. Look at the resulting spectrum.

h = ita_read('loudspeaker_response_raw.ita');
h.plot_time_dB;
