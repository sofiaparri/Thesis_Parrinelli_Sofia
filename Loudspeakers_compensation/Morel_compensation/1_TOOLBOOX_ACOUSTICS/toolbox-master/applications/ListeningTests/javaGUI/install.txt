% to run, 
% 1.    place file javaclasspath.txt into matlab basis folder (in
%       documents)
%       (http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/ref/javaclasspath.html#btnays7-1)
%       (dynamic path does not work)
%       In this path, the directory of the GUI needs to be present.
%       also, a like to the jinput.jar needs to be present
%       this is my javaclasspath.txt:
%       /home/jangerrit/local/dokumente/svn/svnToolbox/applications/ListeningTests/javaGUI/java/bin/java7/
%       d:/hg-toolbox/applications/ListeningTests/javaGUI/jinput/jinput.jar

% 2.    to get matlab to load the stupid jinput.dlls they have to be copied into
%       the matlab bin/arch folder
%       the dlls are at the directory jinput/
