## Submitting Bugfixes and Features

For style guidelines and best practices in writing code for the ITA-Toolbox please take a look at the corresponding [Wiki section](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/ita/toolbox/wikis/home).

You can contribute bugfixes and features by submitting [merge requests](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/ita/toolbox/merge_requests) to the repository.
Make sure that you follow the following guidelines:
* It is highly recommended that you generate a new branch when working on a bugfix or a new feature.
* Work on your fix/feature inside your new branch.
* Create representative tests for your code if you create a new feature.
* Once finished file the merge request. Your merge request will now be reviewed and discussed.
* After all discussions are resolved and your request gets approved your code will be merged into the master branch.
